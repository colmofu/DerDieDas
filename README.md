# DerDieDas?


## Description

`DerDieDas?` is currently under development. The idea is to create a google chrome plug-in wish supports German-language learning enthusiasts with reinforcement learning and support when determining the appropriate gender for nouns in German. 

As a C1 speaker of German, I often find myself knowing the noun I needed to write, however, am often clueless when it comes to the gender article that should accompany the noun. `DerDieDas?` will attempt to help aspiring German speakers and writers by identifying the appropriate article to use when a user scrolls over a type-written noun. This will help writers remain in the flow instead of needing to check a translator, Duden, or worse of all, their German course notes.

First intended for German as an MVP, with later editions to include other languages.

This is a hobby project based out of my own interests with the idea of expanding my skills! Please reach out if you have any suggestions and/or would like to contribute. 

## Installation & Usage

It will eventually be found on the Google Chrome extension store.
